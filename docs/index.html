<dt><strong>“…and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversations?”</strong></dt>
<dd>
L. Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
</dd>
</dl>
<p>But this book is entirely made up of conversation, and for better conversation! It is targeted at HR leaders who practice or aspire to practice People Analytics and intend to do so by having better conversations with data scientists. It offers my experience as a data scientist in discussions with HR leaders I supported on their journey to data-driven organizations.</p>
<p>Inspired by the famous book Alice’s Adventure in Wonderland, I gathered many pieces of knowledge that comprise my story. My career was always on the spectrum between people and businesses, and data mediates between these two poles. The use cases I present will show you how. In addition, it will support your learning in my training programs or others, leveraging available datasets that demonstrate how you communicate with a data scientist who happens to use R and RStudio.</p>
<p>This book is unique in the domain of People Analytics because it interwinds two well-known conceptual models: “Employee Lifetime Value” and “Analytics Maturity.” Combining both conceptual models enables a thorough understanding of real People Analytics projects. Furthermore, I did not create the simulations to make HR professionals become data scientists but rather to train them to work with data scientists. Therefore, each use case follows similar steps that enable simulating a conversation with a data scientist.</p>
<p><strong>“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange adventures… </strong>
But our adventure is certainly not a dream! Let’s Start.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Why Littalics in wondeRland?<a href="index.html#why-littalics-in-wonderland" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>I’ve always been an autodidact. In my <a href="https://www.littalics.com/littal-shemer-haim/">+25 years of professional experience</a>, I was an eternal student in many fields: data science, business, technology, consultancy, writing, photography, and more. However, nothing prepared me for the wonder of learning and mastering R.</p>
<p>I took my first steps into R programming in 2015 and never quit. I used R to explore various research and methodologies and leveraged it in my consultancy in many creative ways. At this point in my journey, I needed to organize my resources and experiences in R to be more productive, in the projects and workshops I offer.</p>
<p>Inspired by the famous book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">Alice’s Adventure in Wonderland</a>, I gathered many pieces of knowledge that comprise my story and shared them in an open-book format. Alice figured out in the book that “It’s no use going back to yesterday” because she was a different person back then. However, connecting yesterday’s dots brought me to the person I am today, professionally and personally. Returning to my archive was a way to combine my learning dots into solid content that represents me today.</p>
<p>The nickname Littalics is another representation of my connected dots. It started as Littalics on <a href="https://twitter.com/Littalics">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Littalics">Facebook</a>. This nickname referred to Analytics, Statistics, Infographics, Ethics, and all other hashtags ended with the suffix ‘ics.’ Eventually, people recognized me off-line with that name. So, <a href="https://www.littalics.com/">Littalics</a> became a domain name and a business identity.</p>
<p>The title of this book, Littalics in wondeRland, implies that it is about my journey in the field and my attempt to organize and share the complex body of knowledge that serves me. But before we take the deep dive into R, I’d like to share some context on the domain of expertise in which I used R.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Why People Analytics<a href="index.html#why-people-analytics" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The practice of data science is multidisciplinary. It encompasses three general skills – the business domain of expertise, statistical modeling, and programming. Although I used the term Applied Research for most of my career to describe my practice, I experienced the complexity of the data science profession.</p>
<p>I have been a consultant in Organizational Research for more than twenty years, long before “People Analytics” emerged. I offered insights into employee experience, performance measures, collaboration, internal customer satisfaction, safety climate, training assessments, etc. To do so, I had to leverage multidisciplinary skills.</p>
<p>I considered my practice a career on a spectrum between people and businesses. Data mediates between these two poles because you reveal every action or transaction between people and companies through the data.</p>
<p>I had to be an expert in many organizational use cases while analyzing them by the proper methodology and write my analysis as code for reproducibility, which contributed to the profitability of my small business. Therefore, I was a data scientist, and my projects, which served executives in Human resources, were People Analytics projects, i.e., the data science of HR.</p>
<p>People Analytics is still a new and growing field. As such, it encounters obstacles and barriers. I think that there is a vicious circle in this field. On the one hand, data literacy among HR professionals is insufficient. On the other hand, there is inadequate open data and use case demos for learning.</p>
<p>I developed learning programs in People Analytics to overcome this vicious circle in recent years. I leveraged the handful of open data sets and created learning materials that included domain expertise, research methodology, and code. I incorporated most of these learning materials in this book.</p>
<p>Though powerful, the use of R in HR is surprisingly uncommon. So before diving into People Analytics use cases, my choice to use R and my source of inspiration in open-source culture is worth explaining.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Why R and Rstudio?<a href="index.html#why-r-and-rstudio" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>I have used SPSS and other statistics and analytics software for over twenty years. Then, one day, a former client mentioned that I should have abandoned them and started using R.</p>
<p>Curious and confused, I googled it. Then I downloaded R for free and followed recommendations to use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> as my programming environment (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a>), again for free. Next, I searched for some additional resources and thought I should give it a try. It took me only a few weeks to discover huge advantages.</p>
<p>First, I was happy to discover that my learning was fast and pleasant. My background in statistics and programming made it relatively easy for me to adapt. Furthermore, the endless resources I found online were a significant tailwind. Indeed, I owe much of my progress to R communities and the open-source culture. When I searched for advanced learning programs and more structured learning paths, I could choose from various affordable programs online created by leading universities and professional experts.</p>
<p>Secondly, I could do anything I knew and embrace new tricks quickly and completely free. Soon enough, I discovered the vast ecosystem of libraries. I could pick the right ones for any use, from data manipulation to visualization to modeling to reporting. Fortunately, so many brilliant players in the R ecosystem continue contributing as you read those lines, making data science practices more effortless and productive. I must admit that I was lucky to start my R journey when most of the libraries in R that comprise the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">Tidyverse</a> had been launched already.</p>
<p>Finally, R is a statistical programming language created by scientists for scientists. Therefore, many of its solutions also fit many use cases of applied research in a business context. However, in the business environment, most people are non-software experts. Fortunately, internal data clients can use R scripts and projects as is or with their other analytics and reporting tools in their organization.</p>
<p>The easy and quick adoption, the flexible and productive usage, and the suit to the business environment encouraged me to combine R with my professional practice and business activity.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Combining it all<a href="index.html#combining-it-all" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>This open-book attempts to integrate my personal career experiences with People Analytics use cases and data science practices. To realize this integration, I followed two well-known conceptual models that served me on my journey: the first model is “Employee Lifetime Value,” and the second is “Analytics Maturity.”</p>
<p>I came up with the idea to bind these two conceptual models during the workshops I offered in People Analytics. I wanted to enable HR professionals to impact the business by raising the right business questions and leveraging findings and insights derived from people’s data. But HR professionals can support business decision-making only when they communicate those questions to data scientists.</p>
<p>I tried to encourage HR professionals to be proactive in conversations with the data scientist who supports their work. Such conversations mediate data science and the business needs in workforce-related analysis and yield impactful storytelling with data. Therefore, I created simulations for them to enable upskilling and reskilling in analytical mindset and critical thinking without becoming data professionals.</p>
<p>Each simulation I created included a workforce use case at some point in the employee lifecycle. It also leveraged the use case to demonstrate a practice or methods in data science. Eventually, combining points on the employee lifecycle and data science practices offered a thorough understanding of real People Analytics projects.</p>
<p>The main section of this book (Part 3) includes those simulations. It contains eight chapters; each depicts a People Analytics use case and explores a relevant topic in data science. The structure of the eight chapters covers phases of the two conceptual models, “Employee Lifetime Value” and “Analytics Maturity, and essentially interwinds them.</p>
<p>From my experience, the best way to develop HR professionals’ data literacy is by using HR data. Therefore, I used open data sources similar to organizational data sets in most learning programs. However, the available open data on HR topics limited my endeavor. Nevertheless, I gathered data resources covering many stages in the employee lifecycle and used them in all analytics maturity levels after anonymizing and randomizing them.</p>
<p>The concept of “Employee Lifetime Value” is reviewed in the <strong>1st module</strong> and serves as a basis for understanding the analytics processes and data preparation. To proceed with data exploration, visualizations, and hypotheses, I used a dataset of Employee Absenteeism in the <strong>2nd module</strong>. Next, testing hypotheses with ANOVA and linear regression is demonstrated in the <strong>3rd module</strong>, leveraging the use case of the Gender Pay Gap.</p>
<p>I dedicated the two subsequent modules to advanced analytics: In <strong>module 4</strong>, I used Performance Measures to demonstrate data reduction with factor analysis. In <strong>module 5</strong>, I predicted Employee Attrition with logistic regression.</p>
<p>The following two modules describe semantic analytics: understanding meaning and social context. In <strong>module 6</strong>, I used Exit Surveys data to analyze text and Categorical data. In <strong>module 7</strong>, I explored team collaboration with Organization Network Analysis.</p>
<p>The <strong>last module</strong> is an exception. It does not bring a use case or analytics. Instead, I wrapped up with a review of the future of People Analytics, in which such use cases are automated. In the automation phase, new Ethics considerations become crucial. However, understanding the practical foundations of ethics is a learning topic that, in my opinion, should be seeded when starting the People Analytics journey.</p>
<p>As mentioned, I did not create the simulations to make HR professionals become data scientists but rather to train them to work with data scientists. Therefore, each chapter that includes a People Analytics use case follows similar steps that enable simulating conversation with a data scientist that supports HR work: use case description, data source, HR briefing, analytics methods review, analysis using R, storytelling with data, and conclusions. The best use of each chapter is to follow these steps to generalize them in a real-life situation where a data scientist is providing an analytics project.</p>
<p>This book is not a textbook about R programming. Instead, it focuses on applying R programming in various use cases in People Analytics. Therefore, I did not cover the basics of R programming and focused only on reviewing R code relevant to those use cases. Frankly, I don’t see any point in repeating the best R open books that serve me as frequent learning materials. However, when using various analytics, I referred to other R available books where the reader can expand on the topic.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you are new to R, I organized all the references for getting started in the next section to ensure that you are ready - or R ready. However, suppose you are a people scientist or analyst; leverage the use cases to expand your tool kit to use R and, if you already do so, to have new ideas about additional use cases and research solutions.</p>
